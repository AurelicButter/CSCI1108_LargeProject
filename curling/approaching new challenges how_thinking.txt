How to make sure that we end up in the black dot? 

possibility 1: 
- we miss the complete circle

how do we notice? 
- After a certain amount of time we have not sensed black yet 

How could we catch that in the code? 
- so we set a timer for 6 seconds or something like that 
- then we let the robot go whatever direction is more likely to have missed it 
- let it go the way back 
- correct course 
-let it go forward again 

possibility 2: 
- we only hit the grey
how do we notice? 
we hit gray for a longer time 

How could we catch that in the code? 
- set timer for how long we go over black 
--> ok if only very short and BOTH sensors must sense it
- and after it needs to be white again (however it would also be white if we missed it)
--> if it hit too long (then going back and correct course )or only one sensor hit it (then going back and correcting the course in the direction of this sensor)


possibility 3: 
- we only hit grey and white
how do we notice? 
we hit grey, then white (which is right until there)
but: then gray again 

How could we catch that in the code?
