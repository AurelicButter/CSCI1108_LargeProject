#working version 
#possible mistake 1: time adjustment is inaccurate about 5 seconds depending on which 
#position the robot starts 
#possible mistake 2: robot could fall of since it does not correct the course when 
#it sees the black line again
#possible mistake 3: robot hits field but only grey/white areas and just goes on
